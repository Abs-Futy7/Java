Deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other's resources, 
leading to an infinite wait state.

Example Scenario:

    Thread A locks Resource 1 and waits for Resource 2.
    Thread B locks Resource 2 and waits for Resource 1.
    Since neither thread can proceed, deadlock occurs.
