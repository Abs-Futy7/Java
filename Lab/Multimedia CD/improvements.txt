1. Use Polymorphism for Media Types

Currently, you have separate Audio and Video classes with very similar code.
Instead, consider creating a Media superclass with Audio and Video subclasses.
This will reduce code duplication and allow you to handle both types of media more generically.


2. Consolidate Format Checking in Controller

With the above polymorphism in place, Controller can be simplified.
Instead of two methods (checkFormat(Audio audio, Application app) and
checkFormat(Video video, Application app)), you can have a single
method checkFormat(Media media, Application app).
