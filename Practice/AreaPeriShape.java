/*
 Write a Java program to create a class called "Shape" with abstract methods for calculating area and perimeter,
 and subclasses for "Rectangle", "Circle", and "Triangle".

Note: An abstract class is a class that is declared abstractâ€”it may or may not include abstract methods.
Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclassed.

An abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation
(without braces, and followed by a semicolon).
